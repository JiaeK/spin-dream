## Setup your development environment

You need Opam, you can install it by following [Opam's documentation](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

With Opam installed, you can install the dependencies in a new local switch with:

```bash
make switch
```

Or globally, with:

```bash
make deps
```

Then, build the project with:

```bash
make build
```

### Running the server

```bash
make test
```
